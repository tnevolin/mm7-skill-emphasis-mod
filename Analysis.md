# Vanilla weapon and armor skill progression analysis

## Attack

##### Common bonuses

|source|value min|value max|
|----|----:|----:|
|accuracy effect|10|10|
|weapon bonus|10|20|
|buffs (Bless)|15|15|

##### Chance to hit proportional improvement for +1 attack bonus

|current bonus|improvement|
|----:|----:|

|10|4.7%|
|20|2.8%|
|30|2.0%|
|40|1.5%|
|50|1.2%|

Early game imporvement is relatively noticeable but it diminishes significantly as game progresses.

## Speed

I am calculating effects for new positive speed bonus mechanics not for vanilla negative recovery bonus mechanics.

##### Common bonuses

|source|value min|value max|
|----|----:|----:|
|speed effect|10|10|
|weapon base speed|0|20|
|buffs (Haste)|25|25|
|skill|10|10|
|total|35|55|

##### Speed improvement for +1 speed bonus

|current bonus|improvement|
|----:|----:|
|0|1.0%|
|10|0.9%|
|20|0.8%|
|30|0.8%|
|40|0.7%|	
|50|0.7%|

Early game imporvement is moderate. However it declines moderately too.

## Damage

##### Common bonuses

|source|value min|value max|
|----|----:|----:|
|might effect|10|10|
|weapon damage|10|20|
|weapon bonus|10|20|
|weapon enchantments|10|20|
|buffs (Heroism)|15|
|skill|10|10|
|total|65|95|

##### Damage improvement for +1 damage bonus

|current bonus|improvement|
|----:|----:|
|20|5.0%|
|40|2.5%|
|60|1.7%|
|80|1.3%|
|100|1.0%|

Early game imporvement is huge due to low combined damage at the time. End game improvement is still quite significant.

## AC

##### Common bonuses

|source|value min|value max|
|----|----:|----:|
|speed effect|10|10|
|equipment|45|45|
|armor|25|55|
|shield|0|20|
|buffs (Stone Skin)|15|15|
|armor skill|10|10|
|shield skill|0|30|
|total|105|185|

##### Monster chance to hit decrease for +1 AC bonus

|current bonus|improvement|
|----:|----:|
|0|5.0%|
|30|1.1%|
|60|0.6%|
|90|0.4%|
|120|0.3%|
|150|0.3%|

Similar to attack bonus the effectiveness of AC bonus falls even more drastically toward the end of the game.
